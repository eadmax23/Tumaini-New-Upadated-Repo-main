                                    <p>These projects are mainly intended for the school to serve the main thing which
                                        may be required by the students during their operation in school. The projects
                                        are under control or supervision of the specific people which are mainly
                                        intended to prevent students from being involved in domesticating and other
                                        garden activities. These are only important projects which are mostly intended

                                    <h4>Livestock Keeping</h4>

                                        livestock keeping. The aim of the project is supply milk to students with its

                                    <h4>Garden Cultivation</h4>
                                    <p>Tumaini Senior Secondary School own a garden which act as a provider of
                                        vegetables and other spices which may be required for the food. The school
                                        garden is about 1.5 acers which serves the whole school. In School, we do eat
                                        vegetable which we grow on the school garden instead of buying from the market.
                                        The school has employed the people to work on the garden instead of students
                                        working in the garden.</p>
                                    <h4>Plantation of Tree</h4>
                                    <p>Before the school closure, there is program of planting trees around the school.
                                        These involves all school staff members and students. When you move around
                                        Tumaini Senior Secondary School you find out that there many green trees around
                                        this is because the students help to irrigate the trees during summer season. In
                                        Tumaini Senior Secondary School we do encourage planting trees in order to
                                        conserve the environment.</p>
